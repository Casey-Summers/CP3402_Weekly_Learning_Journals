# Week 2 - Learning Journal
This week I focused on starting to get an understanding of the difference between a locally hosted website, and a publicly available one. I also studied the difference in how you go about hosting them and what this means when trying to push changes.
Although it was not necessary to locally host my website for this practical, I still attempted to. I was able to create a local environment using XAMPP, MySQL, PHP, and Joomla, and I was able to customise the website locally too. However, I ran into issues
when trying to sync my local environment with a hosting service. This is something I plan to study further in later practicals, despite the website I submitted for this week. <br>

Otherwise, I watched the recommended 'LinkedIn Learning' videos on WordPress, which clarified a few questions I had from the previous week and also sparked my interest in starting a local environment. I also studied some 'backend' `menu` and `menu item` adding tutorials for Joomla.

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `4` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week, I researched which hosting service would be best for launching a Joomla site, and I decided on CloudAccess. They offer Joomla preinstalled, and they have a free tier for basic websites. I also learned how to set up a Joomla site both locally and publicly. This involved using XAMPP to create a local environment with SQL and Apache. For the public site, I used a subdomain from CloudAccess to host my Joomla website. Once the domain was created, I was able to access "content" and "menus," which turned out to be less intuitive than I expected. To figure out how to manipulate these elements, I watched several tutorial videos. I focused on removing unnecessary metadata and cloning some of my existing HTML code. 
<br><br>
I struggled to find a way to edit the default template to either be blank or fit my needs. However, I eventually found and installed a template, but it didnâ€™t look appropriate for my site, and I wasn't sure how to edit it. Moving forward, I will focus on understanding template editing and syncing my local and public environments.


# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

**Career**: This week, my learnings about Joomla, hosting, and local development have been really useful as they lay a solid foundation for web development. These skills are highly relevant for careers in IT and web development, where the ability to manage websites locally and on live servers is crucial. Customising templates in Joomla will definitely come in handy for future roles in web design.
<br><br>
**Employability**: These skills transfer well to many roles in web development and IT support. Working with content management systems like Joomla, managing local and live environments, and handling website deployment are all common tasks in many positions, including Web Developer, IT Support Specialist, and Systems Administrator. Knowledge of hosting providers, templates, and database management is highly relevant for various technical positions.
<br><br>
**Insights**: This week, I've learned that what may be easy and intuitive in one aspect of IT, is the complete opposite in another. I found that I struggled with the whole new system of a CMS, and would much prefer just to write the code in HTML where I feel I have more control over what is happening. I disliked the feeling of having a middle-man trying to decide what I wanted and forcing me to create 'content' that was attributed to 'menus'. Despite this, I am sure with more experience I will learn how it is innovative and saving millions of other developers time over traditional methods. I also suspect that it may just be a Joomla issue, and I certainly hope that WordPress is a bit easier (from what I've seen so far).
