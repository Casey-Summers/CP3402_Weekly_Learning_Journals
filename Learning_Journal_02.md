# Week 2 - Learning Journal
This week I focused on starting to get an understanding of the difference between a locally hosted website, and a publicly available one. I also studied the difference in how you go about hosting them and what this means when trying to push changes.
Although it was not necessary to locally host my website for this practical, I still attempted to. I was able to create a local environment using XAMPP, MySQL, PHP, and Joomla, and I was able to customise the website locally too. However, I ran into issues
when trying to sync my local environment with a hosting service. This is something I plan to study further in later practicals, despite the website I submitted for this week. <br>

Otherwise, I watched the recommended 'LinkedIn Learning' videos on WordPress, which clarified a few questions I had from the previous week and also sparked my interest in starting a local environment. I also studied some 'backend' `menu` and `menu item` adding tutorials for Joomla.

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `_` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I did (brief context)... in the process, I learned about (personal learning)... it revealed this thing about me (detailed insight).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that (topic/insight) is useful... it relates to the industry by (use-case)... I see myself using it because (career applications).
