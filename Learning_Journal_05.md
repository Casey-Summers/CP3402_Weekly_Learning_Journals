# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `4` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week, after watching the prescribed videos, I first attempted to manually create the Child Theme. Very quickly I ran into the error of not properly defining the files as a style sheet or PHP, so I then conducted some research into modern alternatives for Child Theme creation. My insight from this activity was that I encountered an issue and I thought to myself that it is very likely someone else has had the some problem and created a solution. Soon after, I found a very useful plugin called 'Child Theme Configurator', which provides seemless creation of a local child theme upon entering a few criteria. I had learned earlier about all of the header tags that can be used for a child theme and filled them out accordingly. Once the child theme had been activated I used the inspector tool to test changes before making them live.

I learned that the inspector element on a FSE WordPress site uses many 'block' elements which restricts how you can edit individual elements, and also that some styles come as part of the source code and cannot be editted. I also found that WordPress often has a lot of unnecessary padding that needs to be removed. It also uses custom tags and WordPress integration to handle stylisation. 

Another interesting insight I gained this week was that there can typically be no such thing as a grandchild theme, in the way that a child theme would have a further sub-childtheme. The hierarchy of themes is simply limited to parent and child themes because any further depth would create a complexity nightmare of trying to find the right theme level that a modification has been made on. Despite this, WordPress allows 'Additional CSS' to be added to a live website which, although not store within the files and on a database instead, acts as a pseudo 'grandchild' theme.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that (topic/insight) is useful... it relates to the industry by (use-case)... I see myself using it because (career applications).
