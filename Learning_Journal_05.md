# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `4` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week, after watching the prescribed videos, I first attempted to manually create the Child Theme. Very quickly I ran into the error of not properly defining the files as a style sheet or PHP, so I then conducted some research into modern alternatives for Child Theme creation. My insight from this activity was that I encountered an issue and I thought to myself that it is very likely someone else has had the some problem and created a solution. Soon after, I found a very useful plugin called 'Child Theme Configurator', which provides seemless creation of a local child theme upon entering a few criteria. I had learned earlier about all of the header tags that can be used for a child theme and filled them out accordingly. Once the child theme had been activated I used the inspector tool to test changes before making them live.

I learned that the inspector element on a FSE WordPress site uses many 'block' elements which restricts how you can edit individual elements, and also that some styles come as part of the source code and cannot be editted. I also found that WordPress often has a lot of unnecessary padding that needs to be removed. It also uses custom tags and WordPress integration to handle stylisation. 

Another interesting insight I gained this week was that there can typically be no such thing as a grandchild theme, in the way that a child theme would have a further sub-childtheme. The hierarchy of themes is simply limited to parent and child themes because any further depth would create a complexity nightmare of trying to find the right theme level that a modification has been made on. Despite this, WordPress allows 'Additional CSS' to be added to a live website which, although not store within the files and on a database instead, acts as a pseudo 'grandchild' theme.

### Insights:
- Child theme customisation ensures WordPress site modifications persist after updates.
- Full Site Editing (FSE) is changing the relevance of traditional child themes.
- The inspector tool reveals how WordPress structures styles and layout elements.
- WordPress often has unnecessary padding and restrictive block elements.
- Grandchild themes typically do not exist in WordPress due to complexity.
- Additional CSS can act as a pseudo grandchild theme by storing styles in the database.

### Career:
The ability to customise WordPress themes, debug styling issues, and implement child themes aligns with several careers in web development, front-end development, and UI/UX design. Staying updated with new trends like FSE ensures that I will understand the continued relevance of child themes and other important aspects of WordPress site creation. I also familiarised myself with LinkedIn posting, which is sure to boost career engagement and act as a useful tool to record self-development.

### Employability:
WordPress development is a sought-after skill, as many businesses rely on it for their online presence. Understanding how to customise themes, migrate styles, and work with modern tools makes me more competitive in the job market. Additionally, problem-solving and adaptability are crucial soft skills that employers value, and ones that I practised when finding an alternative to an error I had encountered. My exposure to manually performing 'plug-in tasks' has given me a deeper understanding of the requirements behind the tools I use. To showcase these qualities, LinkedIn will continue to be an effective tool for tracking my professional development, and making a post will be a valuable first step.

### Personal Insights:
I have realised that I enjoy finding alternative solutions within web development, especially when it involves utlising a new tool or a combination of existing ones. My research-driven approach to learning helps me quickly find solutions, and I can definitely see myself using this skill to automate and streamline similar tasks. I also see the value in keeping up with industry changes, as outdated knowledge can heavily limit effectiveness. Specifically, I aim to fully utilise FSEâ€™s built-in features, find plug-ins that handle simple and repetitive tasks, and refine my use of industry tools like the element inspector.
