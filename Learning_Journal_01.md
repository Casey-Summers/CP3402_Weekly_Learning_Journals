# Week 1 - Learning Journal
This week I focused on revising my HTML skills by coding a website in VS Code and hosting it with GitHub pages. I watched LinkedIn Learning videos on Web Design and Prototyping. Additionally, I covered some learning resources related to Markdown which I practised by creating a 'Learning Journal' template, and UX/UI principles to prepare myself for future practicals. I chose to focus on Markdown first, specifically the template, as I believe this would save me time throughout the subject and encourage me to fill it in with more insightful responses. My second priority was revising the syntax and usage of HTML as this would remind me of how elements are handled behind the scenes of a CMS. Noting this, I made my other priorities things that would inform my website constructing skills; concepts like UX and UI principles.

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `6` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I put a large focus on my foundation skills, starting from the bottom and working my way towards the top of the content delivery pyramid. More specifically in my case, from practising my Markdown documentation skills to my HTML coding skills. In the process, I learned whilst I was able to remember some features like headings and links, I had forgotten about the syntax of other basic things like bolding, in-line quotes, or lists. It revealed that even though I had recently complete a Markdown tutorial for another subject, I was stilling having moments where I forgot about certain syntax. This led me back to the same learning resource which clarified my mistake. However, initial frustration with myself now sparked my curiosity; I wanted to know what else Markdown could do and how I could allow it to help my documentation skills. This led me to the above learning resources &uarr; and eventually a full Markdown template for a 'Learning Journal'. Through this process, I learned that too many in-line quotes can be distracting or that bolding does not highlight something nearly as well as `this`. It also made me consider how the strictly aligned nature of the language made it easy to read and digest compared to a website bloated with adds or stylisations. 
<br><br>
Otherwise, I found that I was a little more rusty with HTML than I thought. Initially, I tried to see how far I could get my opening VS Code and simply starting. However, I found it was a much more effective learning experience once I had watched a video guide for a simple static website and then created one of my own. Not only did I get a refresher on HTML basics, but I could also apply it to creating a logical and complete static website for this prac. During this process, I realised that the headers and footers of my website were not exactly the most user-friendly or appealing. This led me to revising some basic UI/UX design principles which I intend to apply further in future, as I was not able to fully include them in my static website at this time. However, of the ones I did apply, I found that a banded header attracted a lot more attention compared to one that was flush with the top of the screen.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned in a career?
> - What career would I need to use these skills, and is that something I want/am working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that structured documentation and content organisation are essential, not just for personal efficiency, but also for professional environments where transparent communication is valued. This relates to the industry by ensuring that technical documentation, website content, and even internal knowledge bases are accessible and easy to maintain. I see myself using these skills in a career where technical writing, web development, or even project documentation play a role, such as in web development, UX/UI design, or software engineering. Of these possible areas, I see project documentation writing as being the most likely, as writing process documentation is already a large part of my real job.
<br><br>
Additionally, revisiting HTML and UI/UX principles reinforced how critical a well-structured interface is. The most important areas to apply these to in industry will be front-end development, product design, and digital marketing, or other areas where the clarity of a website impacts usability and engagement. This made me reflect on how I naturally gravitate towards creating structured, user-friendly content (from my experience with process documentation), which is an interest I plan to refine into an employability factor. 
<br><br>
Finally, I realised that I learn most effectively when I combine theoretical learning with hands-on application. Watching a tutorial or reading about a concept is helpful, but actually building something and troubleshooting along the way cements my understanding. This was most true when progressing from LinkedIn learning -> Article guide -> Youtube walkthrough -> Practising myself.
