# Week 1 - Learning Journal
This week I focused on revising my HTML skills by coding a website in VS Code and hosting it with GitHub pages. I watched LinkedIn Learning videos on Web Design and Prototyping. Additionally, I covered some learning resources related to Markdown which I practised by creating a 'Learning Journal' template, and UX/UI principles to prepare myself for future practicals. I chose to focus on Markdown first, specifically the template, as I believe this would save me time throughout the subject and encourage me to fill it in with more insightful responses. My second priority was revising the syntax and usage of HTML as this would remind me of how elements are handled behind the scenes of a CMS. Noting this, I made my other priorities things that would inform my website constructing skills; concepts like UX and UI principles.

# Learning Activities & Resources
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - If you learned from something, link it!
> - Compare why you chose to learn one thing over the other. See the above section &uarr;
> - Format: `topic` | `Purpose` | `Link` <br>

> *Correct* examples: "Watching a learning course, doing a tutorial, getting expert advice, going to a seminar." <br>
> *Incorrect* example: "Doing the prac, solving a problem, making a site."

#### Desired learning outcomes & identified gaps in knowledge: 
- [x] Practise existing Markdown skills and utilise at least three new learned features
- [x] Revisit Git repos and create a template for efficient journal completion
- [x] Learn precisely what a CMS is and should be used for
- [x] Revisit HTML basics and write sample elements
- [ ] Revisit CSS basics and write sample stylisations   (Partially complete with style rules in HTML)
- [ ] Review different JavaScript prompts                (Outside of Prac 1 scope, will attempt later)

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `5` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I did (brief context)... in the process, I learned about (personal learning)... it revealed this thing about me (detailed insight).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned in a career?
> - What career would I need to use these skills, and is that something I want/am working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that (topic/insight) is useful... it relates to the industry by (use-case)... I see myself using it because (career applications).
