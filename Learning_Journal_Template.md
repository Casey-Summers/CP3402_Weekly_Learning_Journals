Original work of Casey Summers. This week I focused on...

# Learning Activities & Resources

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `_` hours exclusively learning for this subject on related and listed topics.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I did (brief context)... in the process, I learned about (personal learning)... it revealed this thing about me (detailed insight).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned in a career?
> - What career would I need to use these skills, and is that something I want/am working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that (topic/insight) is useful... it relates to the industry by (use-case)... I see myself using it because (career applications).
