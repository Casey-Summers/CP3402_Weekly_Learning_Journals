# Week 6 - Learning Journal

# Learning Activities & Resources
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - If you learned from something, link it!
> - Compare why you chose to learn one thing over the other.
> - Format: `topic` | `Purpose` | `Link` <br>

> *Correct* examples: "Watching a learning course, doing a tutorial, getting expert advice, going to a seminar." <br>
> *Incorrect* example: "Doing the prac, solving a problem, making a site."

#### Desired learning outcomes & identified gaps in knowledge: 
- [x] Send invite and meetup with team on group Discord server
- [x] Hold first meeting to introduce team members and collectively fill out the 'Group Agreement' 
- [x] Understand and allocate team strengths to resolve collective group concerns (E.g. your strength in environment setup will help the rest of us understand the connection between local and production)
- [x] Establish group 'norms' and have dedicated channels for each type of project update ('meeting-times', 'project-updates', etc.)
- [x] Allocate some starting tasks based on strengths
- [ ] Begin development (Although we have attempted to connect our environments and have already established local ones, without the content being released, we are holding off from developing.)
- [x] Research best hosting platforms from those allowed (also compare group opinions on hosting platforms)
- [x] Research the best workflow method to connect local code to the final production environment
- [x] Study how to create a good group culture

#### Resources list:
Most of this week's content was about following the guides provided to set up the group project. I have provided resource links related to this when appropriate but have also shared some of my additional learning on group culture.

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose; just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week, I spent `4` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I did (brief context)... in the process, I learned about (personal learning)... it revealed this thing about me (detailed insight).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that (topic/insight) is useful... it relates to the industry by (use-case)... I see myself using it because (career applications).
