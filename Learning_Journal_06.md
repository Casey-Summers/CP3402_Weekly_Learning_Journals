# Week 6 - Learning Journal

# Learning Activities & Resources
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - If you learned from something, link it!
> - Compare why you chose to learn one thing over the other.
> - Format: `topic` | `Purpose` | `Link` <br>

> *Correct* examples: "Watching a learning course, doing a tutorial, getting expert advice, going to a seminar." <br>
> *Incorrect* example: "Doing the prac, solving a problem, making a site."

#### Desired learning outcomes & identified gaps in knowledge: 
- [x] Send invite and meetup with team on group Discord server
- [x] Hold first meeting to introduce team members and collectively fill out the 'Group Agreement' 
- [x] Understand and allocate team strengths to resolve collective group concerns (E.g. your strength in environment setup will help the rest of us understand the connection between local and production)
- [x] Establish group 'norms' and have dedicated channels for each type of project update ('meeting-times', 'project-updates', etc.)
- [x] Allocate some starting tasks based on strengths
- [ ] Begin development (Although we have attempted to connect our environments and have already established local ones, without the content being released, we are holding off from developing.)
- [x] Research best hosting platforms from those allowed (also compare group opinions on hosting platforms)
- [x] Research the best workflow method to connect local code to the final production environment
- [x] Study how to create a good group culture

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose; just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week, I spent `4` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I joined a Discord group, set up Trello boards, and started a conversation about using GitHub for WordPress version control. I learned that mixing real-time chats with visual task boards can uncover hidden team issues and workflow gaps. For example, while Discord lets us share ideas quickly, Trello forces us to plan tasks more carefully, which shows where our immediate ideas might not fit with our long-term goals. This process helped me see how digital tools work together to balance creativity and realistic group expectations.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

**Career Insights**: My experience this week has shown me that blending technical tools with thoughtful planning is very important. Today’s tech jobs, especially in project management and web development, need skills in using platforms like GitHub, Discord, and Trello together. I now understand that the real challenge is in managing the balance between quick communication and careful planning. Of which, is a skill that many modern tech careers look for.
<br><br>
**Employability Insights**: Using different digital tools together has reinforced my belief in smart teamwork. It’s not just about using each tool by itself, it’s about creating a smooth system that boosts productivity and solves problems before they become big. This approach is very practical and makes me more ready for real-world jobs, where employers appreciate both technical skills and the ability to plan ahead.
<br><br>
**Learning Insights**: On a personal note, this week made me appreciate the detailed side of digital collaboration. I found out that managing a good workflow means stepping back to spot small issues before they turn into bigger problems. This lesson isn’t always obvious at first, but it’s key to continuous improvement. It has reminded me to keep learning and stay flexible, which I believe will give me an edge in my future career.
