# Week 10 - Learning Journal

# Learning Activities & Resources
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - If you learned from something, link it!
> - Compare why you chose to learn one thing over the other. See above section &uarr;
> - Format: `topic` | `Purpose` | `Link` <br>

> *Correct* examples: "Watching a learning course, doing a tutorial, getting expert advice, going to a seminar." <br>
> *Incorrect* example: "Doing the prac, solving a problem, making a site."

#### Desired learning outcomes & identified gaps in knowledge: 
Note: This week will focus on my process of setting up and preparing the group for the presentation as a group leader. I have not covered other learning materials and instead focused on getting the most out of our presentation.
- [x] Understand the requirements and criteria for an HD presentation
- [x] Create a presentation template that follows the guide of the task sheet criteria
- [x] Add suggestions to help group members fill in their parts of the presentation
- [x] Create a captivating and relevant intro/outro for the presentation
- [x] Lead a group meeting to showcase my document and explain how team members can use it effectively
- [x] Take feedback and go through an iterative process on the presentation template
- [ ] Rehearse the presentation and actively mark it against criteria for each failed attempt

#### Resources list:

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week, I spent `4` hours learning `presentation expectations` and related topics for this week's practical.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week, I revised the requirements for achieving and delivering an HD presentation. In the process, I learned about how I can best showcase my ideas (and presumably for my group members, too) when they are structure and chronological. For instance, if an introduction to your presentation includes a list of workflows, those workflows should be revealed in the same order. Additionally, it was valuable that I was able to spend some of my own time to attempt to really understand presentation requirements so that I could pass this information onto my team members in a concise and detailed documentation. 

I found it valuable to estimate the time that each section (each workflow) would take ahead of time so that the correct amount could be allocated. For instance, how the development workflow would be longer than the testing and automation workflow. I also got the chance to receive some valuable feedback from my group members when I showcased the template to them. They we very happy with the work put in but suggested that there was a lot of similarity or overlap between the development workflow and version control workflow. This led us to, as a team, decide that the development process would focus on showcasing our chosen solution, while the version control would explain why it was the best compared to the alternatives (with additional nuances allowed in each section for unique topics).

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

**Career**: This week, I learned how important it is to present ideas in a clear, structured order. That’s a skill I’ll definitely need when explaining workflows or technical ideas in future jobs. Taking the time to understand the HD requirements and break them down for my group also showed me how useful strong planning and communication can be.

**Employability**: Planning out the order and timing of each section made our group presentation more organised and realistic. These are real-world skills, as being able to communicate clearly, estimate time, and adjust based on feedback is very valuable. Writing a shared template and refining it with my team shows that I can take initiative and take pride in what I showcase to others.

**Insights**: I realised I explain things better when they follow a step-by-step flow. Creating something useful for my team made me feel confident, and their feedback helped me see how to improve it. I also learned that small overlaps in topics can be fixed by working together and dividing content into more unique and better-structured sections.
