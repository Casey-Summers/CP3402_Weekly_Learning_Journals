# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `5` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week I aimed to setup a local environment that is linked with a database that runs WordPress to be ran, and can have said data migrated to an external environment. In the process, I learned about a third and interesting environment called 'staging', which has the important distinct of allowing developers to quality check a product in a production-like environment before it goes live. It also allows for stakeholders or clients to test recent changes without interferring with either development or live databases. This processed revealed that although I understood the local and production environments quite quickly, it took more reasoning and explanation to understand the significance of a 'staging' environment. This led me to asking a series of clarifying questions within this week seminar and was given insightful responses from Lindsay, which clarified exactly the purpose (stated above) and even old examples of the 'local' -> 'staging' -> 'production' pipeline. I also learned that I struggled with connecting the many layers of VVV to work as shown in the example, instead I found it easier to research modern alternatives and landed on XAMPP with a migration plugin (All-in-one WP Migration). 

To go further, my research and the seminar I attended taught me that although the environment I have setup is perfectly acceptable, the 'industry standard' solution evolves containersation of deployment environments within virtual machines, all interconnected with a single software like VVV. This ensures that environments are easily replicated, highly available, unanimous, and have all requirements self-contained. Thus, in the ideal world, there are some improvements to be made yet.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights  

#### Insights  
- Setting up deployment environments like local, staging, and production goes beyond just moving files around. I learned firsthand how these environments prevent mistakes by allowing testing before changes go live.  
- Industry workflows rely on structured pipelines, and skipping a proper staging step can lead to unexpected failures. This became clear when troubleshooting deployment issues that only appeared after migration.  
- While researching XAMPP and WP migration tools, I saw how different tools solve similar problems but with varying levels of efficiency. Being flexible and open to alternatives is just as important as mastering one method.  
- Real learning happens when questioning why industry standards exist, not just following best practices without understanding their purpose. This mindset shift helped me approach problems more critically.  

#### Career  
WordPress and version control are essential in web development and IT roles. Becoming comfortable with these systems has made me more confident in handling real-world scenarios like site migrations and troubleshooting deployment issues. I also gained insight into how staging environments are used in larger-scale applications, something crucial for roles in software engineering, DevOps, and IT infrastructure.  

#### Employability  
This week emphasised the importance of adaptability. I had to test different methods, troubleshoot unexpected issues, and research alternatives when things didnâ€™t work as expected. These problem-solving skills are what make a strong IT professional. I also realised that many companies rely on containerised environments (like Docker) for staging and deployment, which is something I should explore further to stay competitive in the industry.  

#### Personal Insights  
I gained insight into how I approach different solutions to a task. Sometimes, while it can be perfectly acceptable to blindly follow a guide and reach the end destination then work back to learn, other times it is far better to learn during the journey. This is especially true with complex, multi-layered tasks such containerisation on VVV, where you need to explicity understand what your are doing at each step and the effects that actions is predicted to make.
