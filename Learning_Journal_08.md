#### Desired learning outcomes & identified gaps in knowledge: 
- [x] Outcome 1: Demonstrate correct usage of nested HTML elements and forms
- [x] Outcome 2: Improve knowledge of PHP syntax (loops, conditionals, functions)
- [x] Outcome 3: Achieve consistent indentation and reduce syntax errors by at least 20%
- [ ] Additional Gap: Understand and apply secure practices for handling form input (e.g., XSS prevention)

# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose; just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week, I spent `6` hours learning syntax-focused coding and related topics for this week's practical.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

This week, I did a short syntax-focused learning experiment to see if deliberate, hands-on practice could improve my accuracy in writing code. Specifically for HTML and PHP structures, as last week, I noticed that I had mind-blanks on a few basic statements. In the process, I learned that focusing on small, targeted snippets that focused on a single concept significantly reduced my related syntax errors. It revealed that I respond well to immediate feedback from actual code runs rather than just reading documentation or tutorials. However, my insight is that I believe regularly practising simple code will be more beneficial memory-wise than complex code on rare occasions. 

### Learning Experiment: Improving Syntax Accuracy in One Day

**1. Hypothesis**  
> “If I actively practice writing short code snippets that focus on syntax (element heirarchy, div usaged, indentation) for one hour, I will reduce the number of syntax errors in a subsequent coding challenge by an additional 20% compared to simply reading syntax references or documentation for one hour.”

**2. Test Procedure**  
- **Reading Only (Morning):** Spent one hour revising official documentation about HTML element usage, indentation, PHP function, etc.  
- **Hands-On Syntax Drills (Afternoon):** Wrote 5–10 short, targeted snippets to drill the syntax I read about without a reference. Each time I hit a syntax error, I noted it and corrected it.
  **2. Test Procedure**  
- **Reading Only (Morning):** Spent one hour revising official documentation about HTML element usage, indentation, PHP function, etc.  
- **Hands-On Syntax Drills (Afternoon):** Wrote 5–10 short, targeted snippets to drill the syntax I read about without a reference. Each time I hit a syntax error, I noted it and corrected it.
  - Question 1 topic: "Correctly nesting HTML elements within `<div>` tags"
  - Question 2 topic: "Enforcing consistent indentation in multi-level PHP loops"
  - Question 3 topic: "Using quotes correctly in PHP for strings"
  - Question 4 topic: "Ensuring proper syntax for HTML form elements"
  - Question 5 topic: "Avoiding unclosed tags in nested HTML structures"
  - Question 6 topic: "Recognising when to use `include` vs `require` in PHP"
  - Question 7 topic: "Maintaining consistent indentation in conditional statements"
- **Final Measurement (End of Day):** Solved a brand-new coding challenge “Building a nested HTML layout with basic PHP validation”. Recorded how many syntax errors I encountered and how long it took to fix them.

**3. Results**  
- **During Drills:** Common errors involved incorrect indentation or missing symbols in PHP, but fixing them gave immediate feedback.  
- **End-of-Day Challenge:** Only two syntax errors overall (a missing '/' on an HTML element and confusing `ul` and `li` ), which I spotted quickly. This was fewer errors than I usually get.

**4. Reflection**  
- The hypothesis was supported: deliberate practice helped me catch syntax mistakes faster, but more importantly reduced how often I made them by more than 20% (10+ compared to 2). Reading alone gave me theoretical knowledge, but the immediate feedback from actively coding solidified my understanding.
- I noticed that my HTML structuring and element usage was much more precise and accurate since the hands-on practice. It enhanced what I learnt in theory and built the connections that made it feel natural and effortless.
- I learned that short, simple, and targetted learning can sometimes be favoured in cases where memorisation is key, and the important part of retaining this memory is doing the practice regularly.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
> **Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
> **Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
> **Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

My learning this week has shown me that syntax familiarity and quick debugging are crucial in any coding-related career. It relates to the industry by ensuring faster development times and fewer production errors. I see myself using this skill in future roles where a quick turnaround on coding tasks is vital. Also, the hands-on and do-it-yourself approach of this experiment is sure to correlate well with practical experience gained from the work-place. Especially since this is the place where coding—backed tests prove especially effective.
