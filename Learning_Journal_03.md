# Estimated Hours
> Your "Estimated Hours" section should be a simple, honest estimate of the number of hours you spent LEARNING. You don't need to explain in prose, just provide a time. - Lindsay Ward
#### This week I spent `4` hours exclusively learning related topics for this subject.

# Content Insights
> Guiding statements/questions: :bulb:
> - Entries should not be general. Instead, they must reveal insights about your specific learnings.
> - Instead of listing what you have done, recall what you have learnt whilst doing it.
> - Use complete sentences and record your insights so that you will understand them when you read them again in a few weeks. - Lindsay Ward
> - Sometimes there are not any real *'insights'*, just acknowledge this and don't make things up.

**Insights as dotpoints**:
- WordPress is significantly more intuitive than Joomla, but it still has a learning curve.  
- Plugins can greatly enhance WordPress but can also slow down or break a site if chosen poorly.
- Page builders make design easier but come with limitations unless combined with custom coding.  
  
This week I learned that although 'plugins' extend functionality greatly, they can introduce performance issues or security risks if poorly optimised or outdated. Selecting well-supported plugins and managing updates is crucial to maintaining site stability. I preformed some updates on my plugins and checked their description of features and it is clear they are extremely powerful, and I will need to include them in my website going forward. Following some additional research I was particularly interested in Elementor (see resources list above) due to its overhaul of web buider functionality. Otherwise, this week I decided to get the foundations down for my website as a prototype, in the hope that I can scuplt it how I prefer once I understand WordPress more.
<br><br>
I also learned how page builders simplify design but impose limitations without custom coding. While they speed up development, they can restrict flexibility, making direct code edits necessary for advanced customisation. I also discovered that global styling settings in WordPress themes can override individual page customisations. This meant that even when I adjusted fonts or colours on a single page, the theme settings would sometimes reset them. Understanding how to properly manage global and local styles will be essential for achieving a consistent design.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights

>**Career**: How can your learnings aid your career? <br>
>**Employability**: Are these skills transferable to the real world? <br>
>**Insights**: What have you learned about yourself from your insights? <br>
> - How does the industry use what I have learned today?
> - How do I see myself using the skills I have learned today for my career?
> - What careers use these skills, and are they something I am looking for or working towards?
> - Was there something specific about the way I learned things that was effective this week?

**Insights as dotpoints**:
- See opportunities to ask for help as a display of confidence and not embarressment. It embodies a valuable trait in teamwork of being open-minded and willing to be taught.  
- Clarifying before being asked to clarify; be direct and clear in your feedback to improve learning efficiency.  
- *Adaptability* is a key learning tool which allows you to learn from testing with both familiar and unfamiliar tasks.  
- Too often, groups are disconnect by lack of communication, or non-exsitant updates on group milestones. Active goal-setting and participation is vital.
  
This week a major learning point for me, relevant to group formation, was during the external seminar. During this time I saw the two parellels of desirable teammate features. For instance, one student was confident enough to turn on their webcam and directly speak to the lecturer about a problem they were having. I found it very desirable to have someone on my team that is able to not only identify that they have an issue, but are confident enough to directly ask the lecturer for assistance on it. They were able to take the feedback without excuses and use it as a valuable learning moment. Comparatively, the opposite side of this was someone who was waiting to be spoken to and not participiating actively in seminar activities. Although I realise and agree that this is not inherently bad, the group was relying on the participation of this person and they were not able to contribute meaninfully. This makes me consider: "which would you rather on your team?" and "which would you prefer to be?"
<br><br>
**Career**: WordPress is a widely used CMS, and getting comfortable with it opens doors to freelance work and IT roles. I’ve also learned that businesses choose platforms based on different needs. Thus, Joomla still has its place, even if I didn’t find it as efficient or useful.  
<br>
**Employability**: The ability to quickly learn and troubleshoot software is a key skill in IT. This week reinforced that I need to test things thoroughly before relying on them, whether it’s plugins or team collaboration methods. I also realised that strong communication is just as valuable as technical skills.  
<br>
**Insights**: I underestimated how much trial and error is involved in learning a new system, even one designed to be user-friendly. WordPress was easier to navigate than Joomla, but I still ran into roadblocks that forced me to problem-solve. I also saw how much confidence affects teamwork. This directly informed me being an active participant, which is something I intend to keep up in future practicals, whilst interviewing for a group, and whilst in the group itself.
